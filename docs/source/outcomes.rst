Learning Outcomes
=================

.. note::
        - Learn the basics of CuPy.
        - Learn how to use NumPy with CuPy.


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use CuPy to accelerate Python code with GPU computing. CuPy is a library that leverages NVIDIA CUDA to provide 
fast and efficient operations on large arrays. We will cover the basics of CuPy's features, how to perform array operations, and how to integrate 
CuPy with other libraries like NumPy and SciPy. By the end, you'll understand how to use CuPy to significantly speed up your code's performance 
on compatible hardware.
